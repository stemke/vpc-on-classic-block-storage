# Creating block storage volumes using the CLI
{: #creating-block-storage-cli}

You can create {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes by using the command line interface (CLI).
{:shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #before-creating-block-storage-cli}

1. Ensure you have downloaded, installed, and initialized the following CLI plug-ins:
    * {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI
    * The infrastructure-service plugin

   For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI for VPC Reference](/docs/vpc-infrastructure-cli-plugin?topic=vpc-infrastructure-cli-plugin-vpc-reference).
   
   When you install the vpc-infrastructure plugin for the first time, you must set the target generation to gen 1, `ibmcloud is target --gen 1`.
   {:important}
   
2. Make sure you have already [created an {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-getting-started).

## Create a block storage volume using the CLI
{: #create-vol-cli}

Run the following command.

```bash
ibmcloud is volume-create VOLUME_NAME PROFILE_NAME ZONE_NAME [--encryption-key ENCRYPTION_KEY] [--capacity CAPACITY] [--iops IOPS] [--resource-group-id RESOURCE_GROUP_ID | --resource-group-name RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME] [--json]
```

Example:

```bash
$ ibmcloud is volume-create demovolume1 custom us-south-1 --iops 1000
Creating volume demovolume1 in resource group Default under account VPC 01 as user rtuser1@mycompany.com...

Name                                    demovolume1

IOPS                                    1000

Resource Group                          Default(dbb12715c2a22f2bb60df4ffd4a543f2)

Volume Attachment Instance Reference    none
```

Capacity, indicated in megabytes, can range from 10 to 2,000 GBs.  IOPS values can be 1,000 to 20,000 IOPS, depending on volume size. If you don't specify an IOPS value, it defaults to the valid configuration per volume profile. For information, see the table of [IOPS ranges based on volume size](/docs/vpc-on-classic-block-storage?topic=vpc-on-classic-block-storage-block-storage-profiles#custom).

The volume ID in the above example is used when attaching block storage to a virtual server instance, viewing block storage volume details, and deleting volumes.

Do you prefer to create block storage volumes from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} console? For information, see [Creating block storage volumes](/docs/vpc-on-classic-block-storage?topic=vpc-on-classic-block-storage-creating-block-storage).
