# {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} capacity and performance
{: #capacity-performance}

Choosing the optimal block storage volume size and performance level for your workloads is important. When you provision {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes from the UI or CLI, you can choose the capacity of your volume and performance level.
{:shortdesc}

## Capacity
{: #block-storage-vpc-capacity}

You can specify 10 GB to 2000 GB (2 TB) of capacity per block storage data volume in 1 GB increments. Total volume capacity is determined when you select an [IOPS profile](#iops-profiles). Boot volumes are 100 GB.

## IOPS profiles
{: #iops-profiles}

When you provision {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volumes, you specify an [IOPS profile](/docs/vpc-on-classic-block-storage?topic=vpc-on-classic-block-storage-block-storage-profiles) that best meets your storage requirements. Profiles are available as three predefined IOPS tiers or as custom IOPS. [IOPS tiers](/docs/vpc-on-classic-block-storage?topic=vpc-on-classic-block-storage-block-storage-profiles#tiers) provide guaranteed IOPS/GB performance for volumes up to 2 TB capacity. You can also specify a [custom IOPS](/docs/vpc-on-classic-block-storage?topic=vpc-on-classic-block-storage-block-storage-profiles#custom) profile and define volume capacity and IOPS within a range. Use either the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, CLI, or API to specify a profile.

## How block size affects performance
{: #how-block-size-affects-performance}

IOPS is based on a 16 KB block size with a 50/50 read/write 50% random workload. A 16 KB block is the equivalent of one write to the volume. Baseline throughput is determined by the amount of IOPS multiplied by the 16 KB block size. The higher the IOPS you specify, the higher the throughput. Maximum throughput for a block storage volume is 750 MB/s.

The block size that you choose for your application directly impacts storage performance. If the block size is smaller than 16 KB, the IOPS limit is reached before the throughput limit. Conversely, if the block size is larger than 16 KB, the throughput limit is reached before the IOPS limit. The following table provides some examples of how block size and IOPS affect the throughput, calculated average I/O size x IOPS = Throughput in MB/s.

| Block Size (KB) | IOPS | Throughput (MB/s) |
|-----------------|------|-------------------|
| 4 (typical for Linux) | 1,000 | 4 |
| 8 (typical for Oracle) | 1,000  | 8 |
| 16 | 1,000 | 16 |
| 32 (typical for SQL Server) | 500 | 16 |
| 64 | 250 | 16 |
| 128 | 128 | 16 |
