# Attaching a block storage volume that uses the UI
{: #attaching-block-storage}

When you create a {{site.data.keyword.block_storage_is_short}} volume for a virtual server instance from the UI, the volume is attached to the instance by default. When you detach a volume, it exists as an unattached volume that you can later reattach. These available volumes are displayed in the list of [all block storage volumes](/docs/vpc-on-classic-block-storage?topic=vpc-on-classic-block-storage-viewing-block-storage#viewvols). You can attach the volume to another instance from the list of all block storage volumes, or when you view details about an instance.

## Volume attachment limits
{: #vol-attach-limits}

Although you can attach only one block storage volume to a virtual server instance at a time, you can attach several different block storage volumes to a single instance. The following limits apply:

* Instances with less than 4 virtual CPUs can attach up to 4 block storage secondary volumes, plus the boot volume.
* Instances with 4 or more virtual CPUs can attach up to 12 block storage secondary volumes, plus the boot volume.

## Attach a block storage volume to a virtual server instance
{: #attach}

From the list of all block storage volumes, follow these steps.

1. In the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://{DomainName}/vpc), go to **Menu icon ![Menu icon](../../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) > VPC Infrastructure > Storage > Block storage volumes**.
1. In the list of volumes, click the ellipsis at the end of a row for an available, unattached volume. A context-specific action menu is displayed.
1. Select **Attach to instance**.
1. Select a compute resource (virtual server instance) from the list of available resources, and then click **Attach**.
1. Messages display on the volume details page to indicate that the volume is being attached to the image. When it completes, the image name appears under **Attached instances**.

You can also attach a block storage volume from the virtual server instance details page.

1. In the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://{DomainName}/vpc), go to **Menu icon ![Menu icon](../../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) > VPC Infrastructure > Compute > Virtual server instances**.
1. Select an instance from the list of all virtual server instances. If any block storage volumes are attached, they are listed under **Attached block storage volumes**.
1. Select **Attach volume**.
1. Select a volume from the list of available resources and click **Attach**. Messages display on the instance details page to indicate that the volume is being attached. When it completes, the **Attached block storage volumes** list is updated to include the new volume.

You can also manually attach block storage volumes by using the CLI. For more information, see [Attaching block storage volumes (CLI)](/docs/vpc-on-classic-block-storage?topic=vpc-on-classic-block-storage-attaching-block-storage-cli).
